        The timestamp event is associated with the first subsequent input event
        carrying a timestamp which belongs to the set of input events this
        object is subscribed to.

        The timestamp provided by this event is a high-resolution version of
        the timestamp argument of the associated input event. The provided
        timestamp is in the same clock domain and is at least as accurate as
        the associated input event timestamp.

        The timestamp is expressed as tv_sec_hi, tv_sec_lo, tv_nsec triples,
        each component being an unsigned 32-bit value. Whole seconds are in
        tv_sec which is a 64-bit value combined from tv_sec_hi and tv_sec_lo,
        and the additional fractional part in tv_nsec as nanoseconds. Hence,
