        """Relative pointer motion

        Relative x/y pointer motion from the pointer of the seat associated
        with this object.

        A relative motion is in the same dimension as regular
        :class:`~pywayland.protocol.wayland.WlPointer` motion events, except
        they do not represent an absolute position. For example, moving a
        pointer from (x, y) to (x', y') would have the equivalent relative
        motion (x' - x, y' - y). If a pointer motion caused the absolute
        pointer position to be clipped by for example the edge of the monitor,
        the relative motion is unaffected by the clipping and will represent
        the unclipped motion.

        This event also contains non-accelerated motion deltas. The non-
        accelerated delta is, when applicable, the regular pointer motion delta
        as it was before having applied motion acceleration and other
        transformations such as normalization.

        Note that the non-accelerated delta does not represent 'raw' events as
        they were read from some device. Pointer motion acceleration is device-
        and configuration-specific and non-accelerated deltas and accelerated
        deltas may have the same value on some devices.

        Relative motions are not coupled to :func:`WlPointer.motion()
        <pywayland.protocol.wayland.WlPointer.motion>` events, and can be sent
        in combination with such events, but also independently. There may also
        be scenarios where :func:`WlPointer.motion()
        <pywayland.protocol.wayland.WlPointer.motion>` is sent, but there is no
        relative motion. The order of an absolute and relative motion event
        originating from the same physical motion is not guaranteed.

        If the client needs button events or focus state, it can receive them
        from a :class:`~pywayland.protocol.wayland.WlPointer` object of the
        same seat that the wp_relative_pointer object is associated with.
