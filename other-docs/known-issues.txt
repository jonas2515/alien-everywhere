  - probably compositor bugs

- videos in telegram don't play, only sound
  - in theory all the sw deconding codecs are here
  - not an issue on pine it seems

- h264/h265 videos don't play sometimes
  - in theory all the sw deconding codecs are here

- android isn't aware of cellular network
  - works via custom ofono plugin on sailfish, no chance 

- signal and whatsapp calls take long to establish / don't work sometimes
  - there's an error about focus for a surface, maybe compositor problem?
